Software Developer Trainee
About This Opportunity

Join Ericsson’s Distributed Cloud team as a Software Developer Trainee and help build the Cloud Container Distribution that powers 5G Core and Cloud RAN. You’ll be contributing to real product features, with a strong focus on AI/LLM agentic workflows integrated into a modern cloud-native stack. You’ll also get hands-on exposure to Kubernetes and cloud networking in a production-grade environment.

What You Will Do

 Explore and apply agentic workflows (LLM-powered assistants and automations) to optimize engineering processes and improving customer experience e.g., faster troubleshooting, better onboarding, configuration management and smarter documentation use etc.
 Work with Kubernetes as a platform: help build, configure, and operate services that run in clusters.
 Support networking aspects of cloud platforms (service connectivity, traffic policies, and reliability)
 Collaborate in a cross-functional environment: participate in planning, pair programming, reviews, and demos; write clear documentation.
 Evaluate your solutions for usability, maintainability, security, and impact; and iterate based on feedback.
